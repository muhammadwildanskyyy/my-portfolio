# Playing Old School Games with Python: Recreating the Legendary Snake

Who doesn't know Snake? The legendary game that we probably first played on an old Nokia phone. A simple game where we direct a snake to eat food, making it longer, with the challenge of not hitting the wall or its own tail.

Nostalgia is fun, but what if we could take it to the next level? This project is about that: not only playing the game, but also creating it from scratch with Python.

## Main Concept of the Game

- The snake is in constant motion, the player only changes its direction.
- The score increases and the snake grows longer each time it successfully eats.
- The longer the snake the faster it moves
- The game ends if the snake's head hits its own body or hits an opponent's snake.
- The game board is infinite, players can go through walls

## Technology Used

This project is very minimalist and only requires two things:

- Language: Python
- Library: Pygame and numpy

  codes={[
    {
      code: "pip install pygame numpy",
      language: "bash",
    },
  ]}
/>

## Project Repository

Curious about the detailed implementation? I have published the entire source code of this project on GitHub. You are free to view, download, or even develop it further.

  codes={[
    {
      code: "git clone https://github.com/muhammadwildanskyyy/Game_Snake.git",
      language: "bash",
    },
  ]}
/>

## Further Development Ideas

This game is a great foundation. Some features that could be added later are:

- Sound effects when eating and losing.
- Food with Special Effects.
- Two Player Versus Mode.
- Levels with Obstacles.

Remaking classic games is a very effective way to learn. Feel free to visit my repository, try running the code, and modify it to your own creativity.
